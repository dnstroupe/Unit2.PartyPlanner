# Unit2.PartyPlanner
# Party Planner App

This simple web app allows users to track upcoming parties. It was created as a project during my software engineering bootcamp.

## What it does

- Shows a list of parties entered
- Has a form to add new parties  
- Each party can be deleted
- Fetches and displays RSVPs/guests (extension feature)

I used JavaScript to make the page dynamic:
- Fetching and displaying data   
- Updating the DOM
- Handling user actions like adding/deleting parties

## What I learned 

Through building this, I got experience:

- Using client-side JS to interact with an API
- Storing data in state variables
- Updating DOM elements  
- Basic form handling and events

While small in scope, it allowed me to practice core skills needed for dynamic web apps.

## Potential Improvements

In the future, ways to expand this might include: 

- Adding user accounts
- More details and styling for each party
- Connecting it to an external calendar API

I focused on keeping things simple for now based on my current skills.
